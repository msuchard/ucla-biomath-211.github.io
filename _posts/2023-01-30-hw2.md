## Problem 1

If the current base is $x$ and one waits a time for there to be $t$ base replacements per site on average, the Jukes-Cantor model probability that the base becomes $y$ is

$$
p_{xy}(t) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}e^{-\frac{4}{3}t} & \mathrm{if}\ x = y \\
    \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4}e^{-\frac{4}{3}t} & \mathrm{if}\ x \neq y \\
  \end{array}
  \right. .
$$

In comparing two aligned sequences, suppose that there are $n = n_1 + n_2$ sites where $n_1$ sites share the same base while $n_2$ are different.  Derive an expression for the likelihood of the observed data in terms of $n_1$, $n_2$ and $t$. Find the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for $t$.  Under what conditions is the MLE of $t$ infinite?

## Problem 2

Using the first 30 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome $b$ gene (Table 1), find the Jukes-Cantor maximum likelihood distance for each pair.  Hint: if you skipped Problem 1, try Equation 11.18 on page 158 of _Felsenstein_.

## Problem 3

For the same data and distances from Problem 2, apply the neighbor-joining algorithm by hand to reconstruct the phylogeny.

## Problem 4

Use software to find the neighbor-joining tree.  Try either (1) `dnadist` / `neighbor` from the PHYLIP package, (2) Geneious or (3) write your our own code in R or any other programming language.  Attach copies of your output and source code as appropriate.
